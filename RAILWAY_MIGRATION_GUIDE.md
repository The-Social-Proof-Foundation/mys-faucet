# MySocial Website Migration: Heroku ‚Üí Railway

## üéØ Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Preparation (Week 1)
- [ ] Set up Railway project for main website
- [ ] Configure environment variables  
- [ ] Set up staging deployment
- [ ] Test database connections

### Phase 2: Staging Migration (Week 2)  
- [ ] Deploy front-end to Railway staging
- [ ] Configure custom domain for testing
- [ ] Test all blockchain integrations
- [ ] Performance testing with validator data

### Phase 3: Production Migration (Week 3)
- [ ] DNS migration planning
- [ ] Production deployment
- [ ] Domain switching (mysocial.network)
- [ ] Monitor for 48 hours
- [ ] Decommission Heroku (after confirming stability)

## üí∞ Expected Cost Savings

**Current Heroku Setup:**
- $7/month basic dyno (limited resources)
- Database costs: ~$50/month
- **Total: ~$57/month**

**New Railway Setup:**  
- Front-end service: ~$10-20/month (usage-based)
- Database: ~$30-40/month
- **Total: ~$40-60/month**

**Estimated savings: $10-20/month (20-35% reduction)**

## üöÄ Railway Configuration for MySocial

### Environment Variables Needed:
```bash
# Blockchain Network
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_URL=https://fullnode.mysocial.network:443
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=wss://fullnode.mysocial.network:443

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# APIs
NEXT_PUBLIC_FAUCET_URL=https://faucet.mysocial.network
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=https://api.mysocial.network

# Analytics  
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=your-ga-id
```

### Railway.json Configuration:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.com/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "RAILPACK"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm start",
    "healthcheckPath": "/api/health"
  }
}
```

## üìä Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track:
- [ ] Response times for blockchain data
- [ ] WebSocket connection stability  
- [ ] Database query performance
- [ ] Memory/CPU usage patterns
- [ ] Error rates

### Tools:
- Railway built-in metrics
- External monitoring (DataDog, New Relic)
- Blockchain-specific monitoring

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Mitigation

### Backup Plan:
1. Keep Heroku running for 1 month
2. Use feature flags for gradual rollout
3. DNS-level traffic splitting if needed
4. Database replication/backups

### Rollback Strategy:
1. DNS switch back to Heroku (5-minute rollback)
2. Database restore if needed
3. Heroku re-activation

## üîß Technical Considerations

### Blockchain-Specific Needs:
- **WebSocket Support**: ‚úÖ Railway supports persistent connections
- **High Memory**: ‚úÖ Up to 32GB RAM available  
- **Background Jobs**: ‚úÖ Cron jobs and workers supported
- **Real-time Data**: ‚úÖ Excellent for live validator feeds
- **Global CDN**: ‚úÖ Built-in for fast asset delivery

### Database Migration:
- Export from Heroku Postgres
- Import to Railway Postgres  
- Test data integrity
- Update connection strings

## üéâ Post-Migration Benefits

### Developer Experience:
- Faster deployments (Railway is notably faster)
- Better observability and logs
- Usage-based pricing transparency
- Modern CI/CD integration

### Cost Benefits:
- 30-40% cost reduction
- Pay for actual usage vs fixed resources
- No surprise bills
- Better resource utilization

### Scalability:
- Auto-scaling for traffic spikes
- Global deployment options
- Modern container infrastructure
- Better performance for blockchain apps

## üìÖ Timeline

**Total Migration Time: 2-3 weeks**

- **Week 1**: Setup and staging deployment
- **Week 2**: Testing and optimization  
- **Week 3**: Production migration and monitoring

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- [ ] All services running smoothly on Railway
- [ ] Performance equal or better than Heroku
- [ ] Cost savings of 20%+ achieved
- [ ] Zero downtime during migration
- [ ] Team comfortable with new platform
